In this section, we'll step back into theory for a bit to talk about where the "tidy" in `tidyverse` comes from and why it is an important feature of data. We'll also see how to transform data from "messy"/wide to "tidy"/long and vice versa.

## What is Tidy Data?

- each row corresponds to an observation
- each variable is a column
- each type of observation is in a different table

![](figs/tidy-1.png)

## Why Tidy Data?

Tidy data enables us to do lots of things!

1) Great ggplots
2) Summarize/slice the data in multiple ways
3) Enable Exploratory Data Analysis
4) Ensure assumptions are met for methods
5) Enable Confirmatory Data Analysis

## Beware of columns masquerading as variables!


```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(readr)
fertility_data <- read_csv("data/total_fertility.csv")
fertility_data
```

These columns are actually categories!

Ask yourself: do these columns go together as a single observation for your analysis?

Also ask yourself: What is the unit of observation?


## Making data tidy: `gather()`

Use `gather()` when you need to make a bunch of columns into one column. In other words, when you want to convert "wide data" to "long data."

```{r}
# gather() has three standard arguments: data, key, and value
# data is usually loaded via the %>%
# key is what you want your new categorical column to be named
# value is for the actual values in the columns

# We don't want the `Total fertility rate` column to be included as part of the
# gather() operation, so we use the `-` notation to exclude it.

fertility_tidy <- fertility_data %>% 
  gather(key = "Year", value = "fertilityRate", -`Total fertility rate`) %>% 
  # Re-arrange and rename columns
  select(Country = `Total fertility rate`, Year, fertilityRate) %>% 
  # Remove rows with missing values 
  # (there are countries that have little to no information)
  na.omit()

head(fertility_tidy)
```

## Your Task: using this tidy data

### Exercise 3.1

How would we find the average fertility within a year? How about from 1860 on?

```{r}
# Write and check your answer here
```

## Making one column into many: `spread()`

Sometimes, you will need to go the other direction: take a long format dataset and make it into a more matrix-like format. This is necessary for such functions such as `heatmap()`.

Let's change things around and make the `Country` column into the variables (columns) in the dataset. 

```{r}
fertility_wide <- fertility_tidy %>% 
  # spread() takes a key (Country) and value (fertilityRate) argument
  # Note that we don't quote here, whereas we do in gather()
  spread(key = Country, value = fertilityRate) 

fertility_wide
```

## Your Task - Who is the most democratic?

### Exercise 3.2

Load the `dem_score.csv` dataset in the `data` folder. Tidy it up. Which countries had the highest democracy score in 2007?

Hint: you'll have to use your `dplyr` skills as well.

```{r}
#enter your answer here

```

## What you learned in this section

How to convert

- wide/messy data into long/tidy data using the `gather()` function in the `tidyr` package
- long data into wide data using the `spread()` function in the `tidyr` package

## What's Next?

We've showed you the bare basics of data wrangling in the tidyverse. There's a ton more!

Where to go next?

- More cool functions in [`tidyr`](http://tidyr.tidyverse.org/)
    - The [Data Import](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/data-import.pdf) RStudio cheatsheet also has a section on `tidyr`
- <http://tidyverse.org>
    - `lubridate` for dealing with dates
    - `stringr` for manipulating strings
    - `forcats` for working with categorical data
- Tidyverse community packages
    - [`naniar`](http://naniar.njtierney.com/) for tidy handling of missing data
    - [`infer`](https://infer.netlify.com) for tidy statistical inference

# Closing project

- Try to load in your own data and use `tidyr` to get it into the right format if needed to use `dplyr` to do some data wrangling. If you don't have your own data, do some analyses on the `periodic_table` data you loaded in before using `dplyr`. We'll be around to answer questions. Thanks much!

## Conclusion

Data importing, wrangling, and tidying are often forgotten as being important parts of the data analysis pipeline. The `tidyverse` packages as designed to work together to import, tidy, and wrangle all in a consistent framework working with data frames.

## More resources

- Ted and [Jessica Minnier](http://jessicaminnier.com/) created a free DataCamp course covering many of the topics covered here if you'd like to go back and practice on your own. - Chester and [Albert Kim](http://rudeboybert.rbind.io/) wrote a [free introductory textbook](https://moderndive.netlify.com) to help beginners get going with R. 
- We're biased but we also highly recommend Dave Robinson's [Introduction to the Tidyverse](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/introduction-to-the-tidyverse) course on DataCamp that Chester helped to author in his role at DataCamp. 
- Alison Hill will also be launching a follow-up DataCamp course on data importing, data taming, and data tidying tentatively titled "Working with Data in the Tidyverse" later this summer. You can track its progress [here](https://trello.com/b/JSLbBqWB/datacamp-course-roadmap).

### Post-session survey

We appreciate and yearn for your constructive and descriptive feedback so that we can improve as educators. To further support this, please feel out this [brief survey](https://goo.gl/forms/8rflopb1QXYclmUq1).
